Ubuntu is a great OS, but not the sexiest ever. Apple TV Aerial Views Screensaver is a great way to improve it.

## 1st step - Retrieving Apple TV Aerial Views video files

Apple TV Aerial Views screensaver need more than 12 GB data to be retrieved.

The following Python script downloads them all:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import json
import os
import requests
import sys

if len(sys.argv) != 2:
  print("Usage: %s <path_to_apple_tv_screensaver_files>" % (sys.argv[0]))
  sys.exit(1)

downloadDir = sys.argv[1]

if downloadDir[-1] != '/':
  downloadDir += '/'

response = requests.get("http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/" +
     "Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/entries.json")

screensavers = json.loads(response.text)
for screensaver in screensavers:
  for asset in screensaver['assets']:
    filename = downloadDir + asset['id'] + ".mov"
    if not os.path.isfile(filename):
      print("Downloading %s" % (asset['url'],))
      film = requests.get(asset['url'], stream=True)
      with open (filename, "wb") as filmFile:
        print("Writing %s to %s" % (asset['id'], filename))
        for chunk in film.iter_content(chunk_size=1024):
          if chunk:
            filmFile.write(chunk)
```

where the first and only argument when using the script is the path where to put the video files.

## 2nd step - Removing gnome-screensaver

```bash
sudo apt-get autoremove gnome-screensaver
```

## 3rd step - Installing XScreenSaver
```bash
sudo apt-get install xscreensaver
```

## 4th step - Installing MPV media player
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mc3man/mpv-tests
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mpv
```

## 5th step - Adding Apple TV Aerial Views Screensaver to XScreenSaver

Add this line to programs listed in `~/.xscreensaver` file:

```bash
- Best:         "Apple Aerial"   mpv --really-quiet --shuffle --no-audio       \
                                 --fs --loop=inf --no-stop-screensaver       \
                                 --wid=$XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW --panscan=1      \
                                 <path_to_apple_tv_screensaver_files>/*                      \n\
```

where `<path_to_apple_tv_screensaver_files>` is the folder where are .mov files downloaded in 1st step.

##Â 6th step - Set XScreenSaver to be run at startup

Go to Settings -> Startup Applications and add new entry:

- __Name:__ XScreenSaver runner
- __Command:__ xscreensaver --nosplash
- __Comment:__ Running XScreenSaver

## 7th step - Preventing XScreenSaver to run when a full-screen application is running

When a full-screen applications is running (Netflix, Youtube, Molotov.tv...), you don't want any screensaver to be run. Using the bash script `xscreensaverstopper.sh` restarts idle timer when a full-screen application in foreground is detected:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

displays=""
while read id
do
    displays="$displays $id"
done< <(xvinfo | sed -n 's/^screen #\([0-9]\+\)$/\1/p')

timeout_val=`cat ~/.xscreensaver | grep timeout:`
substring_min=$(echo ${timeout_val} | cut -d':' -f 3)
sleep_time=$((${substring_min}*60-30))

checkFullscreen()
{

    # loop through every display looking for a fullscreen window
    for display in $displays
    do
        #get id of active window and clean output
        activ_win_id=`DISPLAY=:0.${display} xprop -root _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW`
        activ_win_id=${activ_win_id:40:9}
        
        # Check if Active Window (the foremost window) is in fullscreen state
        isActivWinFullscreen=`DISPLAY=:0.${display} xprop -id $activ_win_id | grep _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN`
        if [[ "$isActivWinFullscreen" == *NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN* ]];then
        	xscreensaver-command -deactivate
	    fi
    done
    timeout_val=`cat ~/.xscreensaver | grep timeout:`
	substring_min=$(echo ${timeout_val} | cut -d':' -f 3)
	sleep_time=$((${substring_min}*60-30))
}



while sleep $((${sleep_time})); do
    checkFullscreen
done

exit 0
```

This script must be run at startup. Like in 6th step, go to Settings -> Startup Applications and add new entry:

- __Name:__ XScreenSaver stopper
- __Command:__ &lt;path_to_xscreensaverstopper&gt;/xscreensaverstopper.sh`
- __Comment:__ Running XScreenSaver

## 8th step - Starting XScreenSaver desktop application

- Run application *Screensaver* in Unity.
- Select mode *Only One Screen Saver*.
- Select *Apple Aerial* in the list.
- Choose the desired time before starting screensaver in field *Blank After*.
- Set *Cycle After* to 0 minutes.

## 9th step - Restart computer

Enjoy!
